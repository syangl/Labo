# Labo

This is my personal studying work based on ALEX from Microsoft's open source.
I trying to use SIMD and Pthread to parallelize the ALEX's search and insert algorithm.

# Works
You can find the parts that I have changed in [my_work](https://github.com/syangl/Labo/tree/main/my_work).
I made some adaptations and extensions to apply parts in [my_work](https://github.com/syangl/Labo/tree/main/my_work) to micrsoft's ALEX, I modified some parts in the origin version ALEX([Based_on_ALEX_origin_arm](https://github.com/syangl/Labo/tree/main/Based_on_ALEX_origin_arm)) so it can run on arm. And added simd searching algorithm in simd version([Based_on_ALEX](https://github.com/syangl/Labo/tree/main/Based_on_ALEX)), so I can compare the original version with simd-modified version.(Both of these version based on Microsoft's ALEX source code).
