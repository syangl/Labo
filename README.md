# Labo

This is my personal studying work based on ALEX from Microsoft's open source.
I trying to use SIMD and Pthread to parallelize the ALEX's search and insert algorithm.

# Works
You can find the parts that I have changed in [my_work](https://github.com/syangl/Labo/tree/main/my_work).
I made some adaptations and extensions to apply parts in my_work to micrsoft's ALEX, [alex_core](https://github.com/syangl/Labo/tree/main/alex_core) is the code of ALEX within my_work parts.
